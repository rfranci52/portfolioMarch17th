        <p class="w3-text-grey"> More about me <br> I discovered programing january 2017 by way of a new years
          resolution to read a book a
          month. This new years resolution was prompted by how quickly I was able to read George r.r. Martin’s series “A
          Song Of Fire and Ice” (commonly known as “Game of Thrones”). <br>
          I Started browsing TPB for top Ebooks and stumbled into a coding book that teaches python to beginners.
          Reading through that book and working through the examples took more than a month, I will admit; but that was
          my Print (“hello world”) to coding. <br>
          After playing around with some of the examples in the book for a couple of months, I started talking about
          coding a bit with anyone I knew who would listen. After about a Year of knowing what programming and coding
          is, I started to feel a part of the community in a newbish way. As serendipity will have it I ended up telling
          my friend, a freelance Tech expert that I started coding with python. He really encouraged my to keep at it
          and Introduced me to SQL. He said that it is the language that is used to build databases and it is
          fundamentally important. So I did what I know best and googled: ‘SQL for dummies PDF’. I buried myself in that
          book. One difference I noticed between the SQL book and the Python book was that the SQL book made no mention
          of an IDE so I would just read and try to visualize what was happening. <br>
          After googling around I ended up finding a youtube series about how to use mySQL and PHPmyadmin to create a
          local server and a database and how to allow them to ‘talk’ to each other. I followed the 4 hour tutorial and
          micro-analyzed, tried to follow it for about 2 weeks in my spare time. It was all I thought about during that
          period of time. I was Introduced to new languages like PHP, HTML and CSS. <br>
          Admittedly I barely understood what was going on, I didn't know what the ‘styles.css’ file was doing, but what
          I did know was that the youtubers page looked a lot better than mine. But regardless, I was proud of what I
          had, but I felt like I was just scratching the surface. I kept getting database errors that were barely
          comprehensible. But everyday I would improve and I built a relational database loosely based around my 9-5. It
          not only helped me understand coding more it also helped my understand my job as a user interacting with a
          client. <br>
          I started thinking of ways that I could increase efficiency in my work database. Increasing efficiency is
          extremely rewarding to me. I started looking for work for coding because I find it extremely rewarding to do
          and I would love to do something that I love doing for a living. That sounds like a no brainer!
          Searching for coding jobs was a bit intimidating at first. I just searched SQL, PHP, HTML; things like that. I
          soon found out that there is a positive/negative balance; well at least from my perspective. Positive is that
          these jobs seem to be highly regarded and important for the future. They are cutting edge. The negative is
          that you need to know a fullstack of things to be job ready. Actually the term Fullstack was used in a few of
          the job requirements. I looked into what fullstack meant and I was introduced to a few bootcamps.
          I actually had a friend who told me that he as currently enrolled in a bootcamp for SQL. Unfortunately, I
          actually told him he was crazy for paying how much he did for his bootcamp and the bootcamp that I joined,
          though it was on the lower end of the price spectrum for Fullstack coding bootcamps, it ended up being 3 times
          the amount of his SQL bootcamp. <br>
          I started This bootcamp in January of 2019 and it ends in June. I convinced myself that this bootcamp would be
          the easiest way for me to really get comfortable to the coding/tech community. I am happy to say so far, this
          community is pretty badass. I went to college for Political science because I found the topic of politics and
          history very important and intriguing. I ended up dropping out my third year in because I kinda came to an
          existential crisis because it was hard imagining my life in 20 years as a politician and there was such a
          cut-throat machiavellian nature to it. But the coding community seems so much more of a collective working on
          a common goal to increase efficiency. <br>
          The bootcamp that I am attending is Columbia Fullstack Coding Bootcamp by Trilogy. The first few week we learn
          to fundamentals of HTML and CSS and I finally get an understanding of what that ‘styles.css’ file does. The
          next week we focused on different approaches of how to build a front end website. We used media queries to
          understand what was actually going on. We also used Bootstrap to show how you can quickly build a powerful
          front end. <br>
          We were soon introduced to javascript and jquery. We started making games like a word guessing game and rock
          paper scissors just to get a feel of how the logic of javascript works. We eventually got into using APIs with
          javascript. We used the Giphy and OMDB APIs to get a basic understanding of how APIs work and what JSON is.
          That was the first third of the class and it ended with a group project. We were given teammates that were
          picked by the Teacher Assistants. I felt that is 2 week period was so far one of the most crucial. It tests
          your character and gives you an Mock project where you get a feel for how things would go in the real world.
          It adds an important dimension of coding that is a game changer. The collaborative dimension explores a group
          of people working symbiotically to achieve a common goal. My group consisted of 5 people and the first week of
          the 2 week project we had very little. We would pitch ideas and some were very ambitious but the problem was
          that we weren't really on the same page. There was some competing personalities and I did my best to mediate
          and reiterate the timeline and the importance of a Minimum Viable Product or MVP for short. The second week we
          had a MVP which was a googleMaps API which rendered a map. We connected that the the NYC Open Data API. The
          NYC Open Data website is very robust but the level of organization varies from dataset to dataset. Primarily
          in this group I was tasked with understanding how to produce the JSON values and once they were mapped on the
          googleMaps API, I was tasked with making them produce some unique information. This was challenging but at the
          same time very fulfilling. I felt that I was an important productive teammate and also a respectful teammate.
          I feel that both are equally important for collaboration. <br>
          Currently we are being introduced to Node js. We started off with the basics of using javascript in as the
          backend with node. I built an application that uses Spotify, BandsinTown and OMDB to search for (artists and
          songs), (concerts and showtimes) , and (movies and showtimes). This introduction was exiting because it comes
          full circle a bit with how I started with python and this node js is reminiscent of that. I was pleasantly
          surprised to find out that node has a mySQL library and we had an assignment that allowed me to use my
          knowledge of mySQL and stack that on top of my knowledge of javascript. I built a relational database Using
          mySQL and node js that from the terminal takes commands that are connected to query string parameters. This
          time creating a mySQL database was a piece of cake. <br>
          We were just introduced to express and a already see the power of it and this whole fullstack thing is really
          starting to make sence. Very soon I will Understand the MERN stack. Im sure that is very similar to the MEAN
          stack. I already have familiarity with the MAMP stack with my brief experience with PHP.
